 Manage my python modules in a separate repo!

## Milestones v1.2 

1. Reorganize the repo as a PyPI package and publish on PyPI.

## Milestones v1.1 (all met)

1. All the functions and scripts that output PIV data should put PIV in a .mat container, which only save x, y, mask, labels in formation once, and save u, v as 3D arrays. 

2. The operations that based on \*.tif images should be transformed to work on raw images. The affected operations are: 

- PIV
- gen_preview
- remove_background
